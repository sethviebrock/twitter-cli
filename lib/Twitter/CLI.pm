=head1 NAME

 - A command-line Twitter interface with plugins, prompting, multiple account support, and more!

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.01

our $VERSION = '0.01';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This is pre-alpha software! Do not use it!

=head1 PLUGINS

This module is limited in what it does, for a good reason:
It supports multiple command-line interfaces to Net::Twitter with plugins.
You plug a plugin into an interface. For example, this is an example of what the
twitter_cli script looks like:
    
    use Twitter::CLI::Interface::Default;
    
    my $CLI = Twitter::CLI::Interface::Default->new;
    
    foreach my $user (@{ $CLI->_USER_NAMES }){
        #Create a new user session for each user
        my $user_session = Twitter::CLI::Interface::Default::UserSession->new_with_options;
        
        #Set username 
        $user_session->_username( $user );#XXX: Need to get+verify the username from the config file
        
        #XXX: Get the password from the config file:
        # Not implemented yet...
        $user_session->_password( '$SOME_PASSWORD' );
        
        #Load a plugin with which to run this session
        $user_session->load_plugin('Prompting');#Loads ::Plugin::Prompting
        
        #Run the session with the plugin's run() subroutine
        $user_session->run;
    }
    
=head1 EXPORT

All plugins will inherit an array reference called _USER_NAMES. Access this
via $self->_USER_NAMES . A "user name" is anything specified on the command line
that does not contain a "-" or "--" at the beginning, i.e. a bareword.
For example:
    twitter_cli vividnuage -a --some_flag openprogramming --another_flag
    
In the example, vividnuage and openprogramming are the usernames

=head1 FUNCTIONS

None except a BEGIN block that greps through @ARGV, searching for
-h, --h, or --help, in which case a verbose help message is printed.

This is a MooseX::Object::Pluggable class. Plug in your plugins!

=cut

BEGIN {
    #Match -h, --h, or --help and interpret as "HELP!"
    if (grep {/^(-h|--h|--help)$/} @ARGV){
        `perl $0 --list_options_`;#This will generate an argv parsing error and list commands
        print while <DATA>;#Prints out the __DATA__ section at the end of this script
        print "\n";
        exit;
    }
}
