Configuration:
    Stored in .perl directory in user's home directory within a directory structure
    that mirrors the namespace of this module, i.e. ~/home/username/.perl/net/twitter/cli/config.ini
RSS feeds:
    Users should be able to subscribe to RSS feeds locally of all twitter activity. This prevents
    distracting tweets popping up at automated intervals. Instead, you choose when to view your tweets.
    The RSS feeds will be stored in the aforementioned config directory under accountname.rss
Text editor view:
    Store the tweets that have already been seen in a local flat database. When a command to view
    tweets is executed, only the unviewed tweets are shown.
HTML View:
    Use Template Toolkit to generate tempfiles that can be opened in a web browser. Similar to
    text editor view, with more formatting.
Direct messaging:
    Do you only want to be alerted by direct messages only at a specific time, but that time varies,
    and you'd like to control that time via the CLI rather than logging into Twitter each time?
    Turn direct message alerts off in Twitter and run the application in daemon mode,
    having it send you emails for direct messages while it's running.
Sending messages:
    You use general Twitter syntax to direct or indirect message, i.e. 'd username' for direct
    and '@username' for indirect.
Indirect messaging:
    Want to be alerted when someone indirect messages you? No problem! Specify that in the config
    options
Config and Args:
    All config is modified via CLI like so:
    username1 [-abcdefg] --arg1 --arg2 a=option1 b=option2 username2 [-abcdefg] --arg1 --arg2 a=option1 b=option2 (etc...)
